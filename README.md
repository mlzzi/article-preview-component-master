## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass
- BEM

### What I learned

First time using Sass. I liked a lot because it makes the project cleaner and better to work with.
I've done a step ahead using javascript in the share button. A simple usage, but was nice to do it. Looking forward to use React Js.

### Continued development

I will continue to use Javascript and as soon I think that I understand it better well I'll start to learn and build stuff with React JS.
